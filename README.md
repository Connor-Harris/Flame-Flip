Flame-Flip is a budgeting app, written in Java, which allows home flippers to analyze potential deals and organize their plan and expenses during a renovation. It uses Java's swing package for its graphical user interface.

There are two modes. First, Analyze Mode: The app will inform the user the maximum price he/she should offer for the property (user must input profit goal, planned after-repair value, all renovation items, buying costs [percent of purchase price], closing costs [percent of after-repair value], loan information [IR rate and principal], and planned project length [from date of loan to day the home sells]). The app has a display page which shows the user the percent return-on-investment, the maximum purchase price, and all costs (including estimated total interest and the sum of renovation costs).

The second mode is Execution Mode. This assumes that the user has already purcahsed the home. The only difference is that the variable changes from maximum purchase price to profit. The display page is the same, but instead of displaying the maximum purchase price (which is now a constant), it displays the total profit.
